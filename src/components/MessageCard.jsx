  You're gorgeous, anyone with eyes can see that...your presence adjusts the whole atmosphere like the eergy shifts just because you showed up.
  But it takes zero efforts to point out someone's face since beauty is the easiest thing to see. 

  But what I see in you, it takes attention..that takes knowing you and that's the part that makes you unforgettable.
  I notice the way your eyes change when you talk about something you really care about. Not only the sparkles but the focus, the passion, the way your whole voice lifts.
  Maybe you don't realize it but that passion, that's the most beautiful thing about you..... 
  I notice your laugh, the real one, the one that takes over your whole body. Just hearing it, it fills the room in a way nothing else does.
  I've seen the moments that maybe nobody else sees, the way you fall silent when you're hurting. The way try to hold yourself togethrr because you don't wanna bother anyone with your problems.
  Like you have to be strong all the time. That strength , it's very rare...this kind of beauty, you can't put a makeup on, can't fake, can't recreate. 
  Your soul, the way you give, the way you love, the way you dream, that's what makes people stay. That's what makes you unforgettable.
  People think they know you because they see your face but if they pay attention that your looks are just the cover, not the story. 
  Yes, you're gorgeous. Your real beauty exists in the parts of you the world never sees....and that's the part of you I never stop being in awe of.

  Again, I don't need anything to tell you how much you mean to me. I swear you're still the same incredible woman. Can't wait to see what this year holds for us.

Happy Birthday, Aishu! 🎉
